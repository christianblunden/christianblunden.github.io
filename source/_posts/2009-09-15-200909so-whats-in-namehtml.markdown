Thought I might kick off my blogging life, besides the obligatory "hi mom - will this thing last" post, with an ever so brief description of the title of my blog and Raison d'etre.

**Developing **- a play on words really, overloaded to mean developing (my software development), developing (my photography/film)  and developing (as in early childhood/cognitive development and what I most want to get out of this blog)

**the **- definite article no explanation really.. (geeky I know)

**right **- another play on words. right (as in correct) and right (as in right hand or creative side of the brain)

**brain **- the thing that I am hoping to change by blogging

Earlier this year, I found myself in a vicious cycle of attempting to read, watch and listen to every possible source of developer news available. From blogs, twitter, news, podcasts and video casts, on a wide range of topics.  The information was in many cases taking a one way journey in one ear and out the other, so to speak, and worse still the more I consumed the more I realised I was missing out on (hence the viscious circle).

The epiphany came to me after listening to, ironically, a podcast by Tom Kelley from the Stanford University ETL series titled [Young at Heart: How to Be an Innovator for Life](http://ecorner.stanford.edu/authorMaterialInfo.html?mid=2054). Tom gives some excellent tips for increasing your level innovation and creativity, the take away points being;

  * Think like a traveller
  * Treat life as an experiment
  * Cultivate an attitude of wisdom
  * Use your whole brain
  * Do what you love

This really struck a chord with me, so I read his book The 10 faces of innovation [The Ten Faces of Innovation: Strategies for Heightening Creativity](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/184668031X?ie=UTF8&tag=builditherigh-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=184668031X)

.  The logical conclusion was basically, I consuming too much information, I had no time to think, no time to create. So hence this blog was born.

So the first step... admiting you have a problem... 

Hi may name is Christian and it's been 56 days since my last podcast...
